            <p class="description">
                The book is a reaction to the self-help industry and what Manson saw as a culture of mindless positivity
                that is not practical or helpful for most people. Manson uses many of his own personal experiences to
                illustrate how life's struggles often give it more meaning, which, he argues, is a better approach than
                constantly trying to be happy. Manson's approach and writing style have been described as different from
                other self-help books, using blunt honesty and profanity to illustrate his ideas.
